# **Basic Sales Summary from SQLite Database using Python**

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project connects to a **tiny SQLite sales database**, runs SQL queries inside Python to extract **basic sales metrics**, and visualizes them with **Matplotlib**.  
It is designed to demonstrate skills in:
- SQL for data extraction
- Python for automation
- Pandas for data handling
- Matplotlib for visualization
